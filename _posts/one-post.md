OS X Mountain Lion: Data Loss via 'Save As'
LAST UPDATED AUGUST 04, 2012 - SEND FEEDBACK
OS X Lion 10.7 removed the Save As command; see Save As Command Forces Multi-Step Workaround, Data Destruction.

To use Save As in OS X Mountain Lion 10.8, hold down the option key for the File menu or command key shortcut cmd-option-shift-S in Pages for example.

But use of Save As is not recommended in general, see below.

Goodbye to your original version

If one edits a document, then chooses Save As, then BOTH the edited original document and the copy are saved, thus not only saving a new copy, but silently saving the original with the same changes, thus overwriting the original.

If you notice this auto-whack, you can “Revert To” the older version*** (manually), but if you don’t notice, then at some later date you’ll be in for a confusing surprise. And maybe an OMG-what-happened (consider a customer invoice that was overwritten).

And recovery of the prior version is an 'if': IF the older file versions are still secreted away somewhere. (I dislike auto-versioning as I have no control over the process or even an understanding of the space used or how long the versions will be kept, etc).

To take what was perfect functionality for decades and corrupt it in this way shows a disturbing disregard for the needs of serious users. Being cool with new underlying features (versioning) is not an excuse for wrecking highly useful features. It is not just weak sauce, it is E. Coli sauce.
